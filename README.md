DATA221-Assignment1-question2.py: A function that converts a list of strings into a nested dictionary containing string lengths and they're even or odd.
DATA221-Assignment1-question3.py: A script that applies exponentiation to pairs of numbers using argument unpacking, while filtering out negative exponents.
DATA221-Assignment1-question4.py: A script that sorts a list of random values and identifies the indices where values meet a specific threshold.
DATA221-Assignment1-question5.py: A function that validates circle radii and calculates the area coverage percentage of a smaller circle relative to a larger one.
DATA221-Assignment1-question6.py: A function that analyzes the distribution of numbers in a list to determine the cumulative percentage for each unique value.
DATA221-Assignment1-question7.py: A time conversion utility that transforms total seconds since midnight into a formatted AM/PM clock string.
DATA221-Assignment1-question8.py: A script utilizing the Pandas library to create a DataFrame and generate a new calculated column from existing data.
